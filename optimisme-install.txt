# If your current version of Fiji or imageJ uses java 1.7 or below, you need to upgrade to a more recent version (1.51) that uses java 1.8 or to force you version to use java 8 by : 
 - downloading java 1.8 
and
 - locating the corresponding 'java' binary and its full path 'FULLJAVAPATH'  and run Fiji or ImageJ using the jar file :
 Example for Fiji (1.51n)
	* java 1.8 lies in 'FULLJAVAPATH/java'
	* Fiji is installed in 'FIJIPATH/Fiji.app/' 
	* Fiji may be launched using the jar file 'FIJIPATH/Fiji.app/jars/ij-1.51n.jar'
	* Type 
		> cd FIJIPATH/Fiji.app/
		> FULLJAVAPATH/java -jar jars/ij-1.51n.jar 
	* This should launch Fiji 1.51n with java 1.8

 Example for ImageJ
	* java 1.8 lies in 'FULLJAVAPATH/java'
	* ImageJ is installed in 'IMAGEJPATH/ImageJ/' 
	* ImageJ may be launched using the jar file 'IMAGEJPATH/ij.jar'
	* Type 
		> cd IMAGEJPATH/ImageJ/
		> FULLJAVAPATH/java -jar ij.jar 
	* This should launch ImageJ with java 1.8

# Install and use the plugin OPTIMISME :
	- copy the OPTISMISME directory into Fiji.app/plugins/ or ImageJ/plugins/
	- cd to the plugins/OPTIMISME/ directory
	- rename optimisme_.java into optimisme.txt
	- launch ImageJ or Fiji with java 1.8 or later (see above).
